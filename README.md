# GRsync
GRsync is a handy Python script, which allows you to sync photos from Ricoh GR II or III via Wifi. It has been tested on Mac OS X and Ubuntu, and should be able to run on any platform that has a Python environment.

It automatically checks if photos already exists in your local drive. Duplicated photos will be skipped and only sync needed photos for you.

**NOTE: Ricoh GR II only supports 20MHz 802.11n. The max transfer speeed I can get is 65Mbps**

## Changes from the original repo

Added options
```
-j or --jpg to only download jpg files
